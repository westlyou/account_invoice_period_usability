Display in the invoice supplier form the fiscal period next to the invoice date
===============================================================================

This module was written to improve the form of the supplier invoice (and refund) by displaying both the invoice date and the fiscal period fields side by side. It is more intuitive for the accountant to have a "single point of modification" for these two so-linked concepts.

The module does not affect client invoice for which the fiscal period has to follow the invoice date.

Tip: the module OCA/web/web_sheet_full_width can help to avoid fields wrapping and loose vertical space in the form.
